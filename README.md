# NFT-PRICE-PREDICTION
In a competition hosted by Bitgrit, participants are asked to build a price predictor model for NFTs given a set of features including:

i.Twitter engegement statistics for a given collection : Average number of likes, Minimum number of retweets etcetera in a given time range

ii.Open-rarity and rarity scores

iii.whether the collection has a twitter, discord and medium account etcetera

I didn't get to make a submission but after a discussion with the winner, my solution might have come second or third if the closeness of our local validation scores are anything to go by
